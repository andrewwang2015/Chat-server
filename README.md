# Chat-server
Using EventEmitters in Node to create a simple local chat server.

In order to test this program, you should use a terminal program that has multi-tab capability. Create several tabs, all of which have shells with the same current directory (the one this code is in). One of the tabs should be used to launch the server:

    $ node server.js

Then, in another tab, start a client:

    $ node client.js
